  abstract = {There is a growing body of research examining the physical and mental health status of persons incarcerated in Canada. However, in comparison to research conducted in other countries around the world, research on persons incarcerated in Canada remains limited. There is also a lack of literature reviews that provide a broad and comprehensive examination of research on both physical and mental health conditions experienced by incarcerated person in Canada and the wellness programming designed to manage these conditions. The purpose of this literature review is to provide a broad overview of the relevant literature from a variety of sources, taking a multidisciplinary approach to examining the health of incarcerated persons in Canada and the effectiveness of wellness programs designed for this population. Overall, the current literature demonstrates incarcerated persons in Canada experience a wide variety of both physical and mental health conditions at higher rates than found in the general population, including acute and chronic physical health conditions, mental health disorders, and suicide. In particular, current research suggests older individuals and Indigenous peoples incarcerated in Canada face an even greater health burden than the general prison population. Encouraging, however, is the reviewed literature demonstrating the effectiveness of a variety of wellness programs implemented with incarcerated persons, including physical exercise and education programs. To encourage further work in this area, the present literature review ends with a discussion of recommendations for future wellness programs and the research work conducted to evaluate them.},

We included adults who spoke English well enough toparticipate inthe discussion and who had been released from the provincial correctional facility inthe previous year. We conducted three focus groups with 18 total participants. Participants had complex health needs on release, including ongoing physical and psychological impacts oftime incustody. They identified lack ofaccess tohigh quality health care; lack ofhousing, employment, social services, and social supports; and discrimination on the basis ofincarceration history as barriers tohealth on release. Access tohealth care, housing, social services, and social supports all facilitated health on release. To address health needs on release, participants suggested providing health information in jail, improving discharge planning, and developing accessible clinics inthe community. This pilot study identified opportunities tosupport health atthe time ofrelease from jail, including delivery ofprograms injail, linkage with and development ofprograms inthe community, and efforts tosupport structural changes toprevent and address discrimination. These data will inform ongoing work tosupport health and continuity ofcare on release from aprovincial correctional facility.},

Quality of evidence: A search was performed in research databases and the websites of relevant Canadian governmental and non-governmental organizations for quantitative studies of health conducted between 1993 and 2014. Studies were included that provided quantitative data on health status for youth or adults who had been detained or incarcerated in a jail or prison in Canada. Main message: The health status of this population is poor compared with the general Canadian population, as indicated by data on social determinants of health, mortality in custody, mental health, substance use, communicable diseases, and sexual and reproductive health. Little is known about mortality after release, chronic diseases, injury, reproductive health, and health care access and quality. Conclusion: Health status data should be used to improve health care and to intervene to improve health for persons while in custody and after release, with potential benefits for all Canadians.},

  abstract = {Background: Many people experience imprisonment each year, and this population bears a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality. States have an obligation to provide equitable health care in prison and to attend to care on release. Our objective was to describe health care utilization in prison and post-release for persons released from provincial prison in Ontario, Canada in 2010, and to compare health care utilization with the general population. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study. We included all persons released from provincial prison to the community in 2010, and age- and sex-matched general population controls. We linked identities for persons released from prison to administrative health data. We matched each person by age and sex with four general population controls. We examined ambulatory care and emergency department utilization and medical-surgical and psychiatric hospitalization, both in prison and in the three months after release to the community. We compared rates with those of the general population. Results: The rates of all types of health care utilization were significantly higher in prison and on release for people released from prison (N = 48,861) compared to general population controls (N = 195,444). Comparing those released from prison to general population controls in prison and in the 3 months after release, respectively, utilization rates were 5.3 (95\% CI 5.2, 5.4) and 2.4 (95\% CI 2.4, 2.5) for ambulatory care, 3.5 (95\% CI 3.3, 3.7) and 5.0 (95\% CI 4.9, 5.3) for emergency department utilization, 2.3 (95\% CI 2.0, 2.7) and 3.2 (95\% CI 2.9, 3.5) for medical-surgical hospitalization, and 21.5 (95\% CI 16.7, 27.7) and 17.5 (14.4, 21.2) for psychiatric hospitalization. Comparing the time in prison to the week after release, ambulatory care use decreased from 16.0 (95\% CI 15.9,16.1) to 10.7 (95\% CI 10.5, 10.9) visits/person-year, emergency department use increased from 0.7 (95\% CI 0.6, 0.7) to 2.6 (95\% CI 2.5, 2.7) visits/person-year, and hospitalization increased from 5.4 (95\% CI 4.8, 5.9) to 12.3 (95\% CI 10.1, 14.6) admissions/100 person-years for medical-surgical reasons and from 8.6 (95\% CI 7.9, 9.3) to 17.3 (95\% CI 14.6, 20.0) admissions/100 person-years for psychiatric reasons. Conclusions: Across care types, health care utilization in prison and on release is elevated for people who experience imprisonment in Ontario, Canada. This may reflect high morbidity and suboptimal access to quality health care. Future research should identify reasons for increased use and interventions to improve care.},

  abstract = {Background: Delivery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) care to people in prison is essential to HCV elimination. We aimed to describe current HCV care practices across Canada’s adult provincial prisons. Methods: One representative per provincial prison health care team (except Ontario) was invited to participate in a web-based survey from January to June 2020. The outcomes of interest were HCV screening and treatment, treatment restrictions, and harm reduction services. The government ministry responsible for health care was determined. Non-nominal data were aggregated by province and ministry; descriptive statistical analyses were used to report outcomes. Results: The survey was completed by 59/65 (91\%) prisons. On-demand, risk-based, opt-in, and opt-out screening are offered by 19 (32\%), 10 (17\%), 18 (31\%), and 9 (15\%) prisons, respectively; 3 prisons offer no HCV screening. Liver fibrosis assessments are rare (8 prisons access transient elastography, and 15 use aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio or Fibrosis-4); 20 (34\%) prisons lack linkage to care programs. Only 32 (54\%) prisons have ever initiated HCV treatment on site. Incarceration length and a fibrosis staging of ≥F2 are the most common eligibility restrictions for treatment. Opioid agonist therapy is available in 83\% of prisons; needle and syringe programs are not available anywhere. Systematic screening and greater access to treatment and harm reduction services are more common where the Ministry of Health is responsible. Conclusions: Tremendous variability exists in HCV screening and care practices across Canada’s provincial prisons. To advance HCV care, adopting opt-out screening and removing eligibility restrictions may be important initial strategies.},

People who experience incarceration have a high burden of physical and mental health care needs and have poor health outcomes. Addressing these health disparities requires effective governance and accountability for prison health care services, including delivery of quality care in custody and effective integration with community health services.             Despite the importance of prison health care governance, little is known about how prison health services are structured and funded or the methods and processes by which they are held accountable. A number of national and subnational jurisdictions have moved prison health care services under their ministry of health, in alignment with recommendations by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. However, there is a critical lack of evidence on current governance models and an urgent need for evaluation and research, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.             Here we discuss why understanding and implementing effective prison health governance models is a critical component of addressing health inequities at the global level.},

  abstract = {Background: During the transition between prison and community, people are at greatly increased risk for adverse health outcomes. This study describes a peer health mentoring program that supports women in the first 3 days after their release from a provincial correctional facility in British Columbia. Methods: We used a participatory health research framework to develop multimethod processes to describe the Unlocking the Gates Peer Health Mentoring Program. Mentors are women with incarceration experience. Between 2013 and 2018, women released from Alouette Correctional Centre for Women were invited to access the program. All program clients were invited to participate in the surveys and interviews. We analyzed survey and interview data using descriptive analysis for quantitative data and content analysis for qualitative data. Results: There were 346~ program contacts from 340~ women over the study period. For every contact, a telephone interview was conducted. Among the 346~contacts, 173~women met their mentor, of whom 172 (99.4\%) completed the intake and consent forms. A total of 105~women (61.0\%) completed a program activity feedback survey at the end of the mentoring period. Women identified a range of needed supports during the transition from prison to community, including access to clothing, social assistance, housing and health care. Participants described a mix of emotions surrounding release, including excitement, anxiety, hope, and a wish for understanding and support. Within 3~days of release, 49 participants (46.7\%) had accessed a family physician, and 89 (84.8\%) had accessed at least 1~community resource. Ninety-eight~participants (93.3\%) reported that their mentor assisted them in accessing community resources. Interpretation: Peer health mentoring provides valuable, multifaceted support in helping women to navigate health and social services and to meet their basic needs. Strengthening health supports during the transition from prison to community is critical to promoting the health and well-being of women leaving prison.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Currently, people leaving prisons face concurrent risks from the COVID-19 pandemic and the overdose public health emergency. The closure or reduction of community services people rely on after release such as treatment centres and shelters has exacerbated the risks of poor health outcomes and harms. This paper aims to learn from peer health mentors (PHM) about changes to their work during overlapping health emergencies, as well as barriers and opportunities to support people leaving prison in this context. Design/Methodology/Approach: The Unlocking the Gates (UTG) Peer Health Mentoring Program supports people leaving prison in British Columbia during the first three days after release. The authors conducted two focus groups with PHM over video conference in May 2020. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and themes were iteratively developed using narrative thematic analysis. Findings: The findings highlighted the importance of peer health mentorship for people leaving prisons. PHM discussed increased opportunities for collaboration, ways the pandemic has changed how they are able to provide support, and how PHM are able to remain responsive and flexible to meet client needs. Additionally, PHM illuminated ways that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing barriers and identified specific actions needed to support client health, including increased housing and recovery beds, and tools for social and emotional well-being. Originality/Value: This study contributes to our understanding of peer health mentorship during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of mentors. PHM expertise can support release planning, improved health and well-being of people leaving prison and facilitate policy-supported pandemic responses.},

  abstract = {The United Nations states that prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community. Despite this, persons in prison experience barriers to care and face unique health challenges. Given the ways in which prisons shape health outcomes for incarcerated persons, it is important to interrogate how the provision of health care is governed in custodial settings. In this article, we examine one important aspect of governance: legislation governing the provision of health care in prisons. We view this issue through a critical lens, building on a body of poststructural scholarship which has illuminated how laws and policies are not merely tools of governance but also key sites for the production of meanings around social “problems,” including the “problem of health.” Taking Canada’s Corrections and Conditional Release Act as a case example and applying Carol Bacchi’s “What’s the Problem Represented to Be” analytical framework, we examine how the specific representation of “health” in this legislation works to produce effects for persons in federal prison. Three key themes are formed through this analysis. First, what constitutes “essential services” in the context of federal prisons is more limited compared with the broader community. Second, the dichotomy between the rights of persons in prison versus the protection of society that is produced in development of these laws has significant bearing on the treatment of those in prison. Third, this representation has negative effects on the health of persons in prison. In order to meet United Nations standards, greater attention must be paid to the ways in which laws and other governing practices reproduce inequities in health care provision in prisons.},
