Although there is\ndisagreement about how those who break the rules should be punished,\nthere is little discourse on the basic human rights of individuals who\nare incarcerated [@{.Scallan+2021}; @bks.Gardner2022]. Simply put, the\nmost vocal voices that argue for more intense criminal punishments often\nhave little or no first-hand account of the day-to-day experiences of\nthose serving time [@{.Scallan+2021}]. Although landmark legislation of\nthe Canada Health Act transitioned Canada into a new healthcare era,\nCanada\u0026rsquo;s incarcerated population purposely\u003csup id=\"fnref:1\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e left out of its benefits\n[@{.Scallan+2021}; @sc.CCRA1992]. Whether for political or punishment\nreasons, it does not matter; no system can exist that does not meet the\nbasic human rights of the individual, incarcerated or not\n[@rprt.UnitedNations1955; @rprt.UnitedNations2016; @{.Scallan+2021}; @bks.Venters2022].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, Canada\u0026rsquo;s federally incarcerated population, or those who face\nsentences greater than two years, falls under the mandate of the\nCorrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA) of 1992\n[@{.Scallan+2021}]. Under such measures, healthcare is financed and\nadministered by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), under the\nauthority of the federal ministry of public safety. Although such\narrangements have been subject to decades of debate, their outcomes are\nclear, as Canadians incarcerated have higher rates of mortality and\nmorbidity than those within the free community\n[@{.Scallan+2021}; @{.Kouyoumdjian+2016}; @{.McLeod+2020}; @bks.Venters2022].\nFor the purposes of this paper, such figures will not be a considerable\ntopic of discussion due to the lack of currently available evidence and\nclear disparities in health and outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 26 years since the establishment of the CCRA, limited progress\nhas been made in addressing health inequalities within Canada\u0026rsquo;s federal\ncarceral system [@{.Scallan+2021}]. As the scholarly literature\ncontinues to accelerate understandings of the intersections of Canada\u0026rsquo;s\ncriminal-legal system, or rather \u0026quot;non-system\u0026quot; as coined by some, the\nday-to-day functions of CSC\u0026rsquo;s penitentiaries remain stagnant\n[@bks.Venters2022; @{.Scallan+2021}]. Although discourse and debate\nabout degree and causation dominate both scholarly and contemporary\ncommunications, the original dialogue that sparked such matters becomes\nseemingly trivialised to the larger picture\n[@{.McLeod+2020a}; @{.McLeod+2021}; @{.Hu+2020}]. In other words, the\nfocus shifts away from the individuals struggling to survive the\ndysfunctions; everyday left of their sentence, surrounded by barriers\npurposefully erected to restrict their freedoms, governed by legislation\nas minuscule as society cares for them\n[@{.McLeod+2020a}; @{.McLeod+2021}; @{.Hu+2020}]. While radical change\nwill undoubtedly be part efforts of a future system that upholds justice\nand human dignity, we cannot neglect the individuals who live within the\nwalls of today\u0026rsquo;s dysfunctions. Critically, it is this resilience that\ncontinues to drive progressive change and the consensus on how society\nshould approach crime, punishment, and rehabilitation\n[@bks.Coyle2014; @bks.Restellini2014; @bks.Venters2022]. While it is\neasy to label the dysfunctions of the CSC, and their administration and\nprovision of healthcare services, its effects will simply add decades of\ninaction since the CCRA\u0026rsquo;s inception. Hence, this paper uses an\nindividual-based approach to target the cyclic health inequalities\ngenerated from the dysfunctions of the CSC\u0026rsquo;s healthcare systems. Given\nthe uncertainties and complexities of the release and transfer of an\nindividual between healthcare authorities, this paper seeks to introduce\nan intervention framework that fits the current logistic timeline, so\nthat consensus can be reached for the promotion of health within the\nlegal, financial, and political bureaucratic constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"commentary\"\u003eCommentary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSolving any systematic problem, let alone all of them together, is as\ncomplex a challenge as even selecting a place to approach it. Moreover,\nreintroducing new frameworks to intervene in any challenge is not\nwithout complication, as new problems could arise or efforts could go\nwithout any benefit. Although a complex web of flawed moving parts\nexists, such an intervention should not ignore its existence. Therefore,\nthe purpose of this intervention is to use the systems already present\nto build on the already known strengths and develop a meaningful\nshort-term impact on a current and pressing challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"healthcare-liaison-officer\"\u003eHealthcare Liaison Officer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven the humanistic approach of this paper, individuals working within\nthe Healthcare Liaison Officers\u0026rsquo; (HLO) authority set out their mandate.\nAlong the already established logistic and managerial chain of command,\nthe HLO would be a front-line staff member responsible for bridging the\ndivide between the CSC and provincial and territorial health\nauthorities. Although all provinces and territories must provide\nuniversal medicare under the provisions of the Canada Health Act (1984),\nvast provisional, administrative, and logistical differences bring\nrationalised complexities and quirks [@{.Scallan+2021}]. While\nsignificant financial burdens would exist, we argue that thirteen HLO\u0026rsquo;s\nshould exist, such that they can provide accurate and knowledgeable\ninsight in navigating their respective system. Figure 1 provides a\nvisualisation of the location HLO\u0026rsquo;s have on the managerial chain within\nthe CSC and Ministry of Public Safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHLO\u0026rsquo;s will work one-on-one with individuals prior, during, and after\ntheir release, ideally to the maximum caseloads permit. Working\nalongside parole officers, family and friends, and other stakeholders\nindividually involved will provide education of available services and\nact as a middleman in transferring one\u0026rsquo;s healthcare file. With the\nlocation under the CSC\u0026rsquo;s commissioner, this intervention takes advantage\nof the strengths of the current system to decrease managerial expenses\nand bureaucracy\u003csup id=\"fnref:2\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e While the HLO\u0026rsquo;s are core to this intervention, the\noutcomes remain in control of those at the forefront of the carceral\nsystem. Critically, this is not to say that these individuals have total\ncontrol over the fate of their actions. The choice to remain engaged\nwith the healthcare system is deeply ingrained in their\nintersectionalities and beliefs about its effectiveness for their own\nlife [@{.Henning2021}; @{.Kouyoumdjian+2016}]. Although the health and\nwellness of individuals ultimately come to their own willingness to\naccess and engage in services, it is the responsibility of the system to\nprovide ease in accessing realistic care. With consideration of the\n\u0026quot;duopoly of responsibility\u0026quot;, the following sections of this paper will\ndiscuss the two core mandates of this framework: education and\ncontinuity of care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/hcLiasionDiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Managerial Organization of the Health Care Lesion Officers (HLO),within the Correction Service of Canada (CSC) and Ministry of PublicSafety.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"healthcare-education\"\u003eHealthcare Education\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ladder of this statement is critical to focus on, as people facing\nincarceration are less likely to engage in the healthcare system. When\nwithin the carceral setting, much of the healthcare received was often\noutside the individuals\u0026rsquo; control or with heavy strings attached, such as\nbeing required to be directly witnessed by correctional staff without\nobjection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor any Canadian, let alone individuals incarcerated, the health systems\nof Canada are complex, often changing, and vague [@{.Scallan+2021}]. For\nindividuals who transfer from the CSC authority, such issues are\nmagnified from years of solitude, before even considering the\ndemographical position in which the prison population of Canada is based\n[@{.Scallan+2021}]. Although information is critical to maintaining\nhealth, the ability to speak and interact with another person who\nunderstands one\u0026rsquo;s position is transformative [@{.Kouyoumdjian+2018}].\nUnderstanding the hesitations people face when simply speaking with a\nhealthcare professional after years of distrust and trauma from\nauthoritative figures is the principle of this mandate\n[@{.Henning2021}; @{.Kouyoumdjian+2018}]. Furthermore, the ability to\nform such interpersonal relationships after release is reflected in\nlower mortality and morbidity rates\n[@{.Kouyoumdjian+2018}; @bks.Gardner2022; @{.McLeod+2020a}; @{.McLeod+2021}].\nAlthough its effects have been limited to those with quality\nrelationships before and during their sentence, the presented\nintervention presents an opportunity to extrapolate such effects.\nFurthermore, while providing education and guidance to the available\nservices that meet the needs of an individual is progressive alone,\ncreating an environment capable of building meaningful connections is\nbeyond quantifiable figures\n[@bks.Gardner2022; @{.McLeod+2020a}; @{.McLeod+2021}]. As the first\nmandate of this intervention framework, education and human connection\nprovide conditions such that individuals can and believe that they can\nachieve better health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"continuity-of-care\"\u003eContinuity of Care\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLikewise with all healthcare services in the community, maintaining\ncontinuity of care is a pillar of medicine and the promotion of patient\nhealth and well-being [@{.Hu+2020}]. In parallel with the mandates of\nthe Mandela rules, healthcare in the carceral setting should maintain\nall resemblance to the community, including its services over time\n[@{.Hu+2020}; @rprt.UnitedNations1955]. While the transition of\nhealthcare from the CSC to the respective province or territory is a\nsignificant barrier to continuity, this paper argues that it is an\nopportunity, as discussed in the previous section on education. In\naddition to easing stains during file transfers, the ability to\nrecommend \u0026quot;new\u0026quot; services, such as safe needle exchanges that receive\nlittle to no attention within the CSC, is a clear advantage\n[@{.Kronfli+2021}; @bks.Gardner2022; @{.Kouyoumdjian+2018}; @{.Hu+2020}].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this paper will not discuss the specifics of its\nadministration, these principles of continuity of care are discussed\nbelow. First, the CSC should provide a complete and comprehensive file\nof the services and history provided during the course during which the\nindividual was incarcerated. Such information should be delivered to the\nHLO in a timely manner to ensure the ease of one\u0026rsquo;s transition over the\nrapid events post-release. Second, the presented file should ideally be\ncovered by as few individuals as possible to ensure consistency in\npersonnel and information available for a given individual. Together,\nboth steps should enable the HLO to act as a intermediary not only for\ninformation but also for emotional stressors released on an individual.\nSimilarly, the continuity of care by the HLO from the CSC to the\nprovincial or territorial health authority should promote humanity and\ninterpersonal relationships to foster trust and belonging. Furthermore,\nwhile an individual is crossing a jurisdictional limbo, they should feel\na sense of care and compassion from those who have access and authority\nover their file. As a common complaint in the community healthcare\nsetting is the lack of compassion of healthcare personnel, the role of\nthe HLO should be to act as an individual that is consistently present\nand is consistently available for questions and concerns. The third\npoint is essentially the result of continuity of care; by working with\nquality and knowledgeable personnel, the jurisdictions of health are not\njust bridges; they serve as a jumping point for new services previously\nunknown. The work of the HLO not only provides ease in one release from\nfederal custody, but helps it achieve better health outcomes, where the\nsystem and its people work together. Thus, the second mandate of this\nintervention framework seeks to further the aforementioned concept of\nthe \u0026quot;duopoly of responsibility\u0026quot;. When both the individual, care\nproviders, and the system in general are aimed at improving health and\nwellness, the individual is more likely to continue working towards such\nobjectives [@{.Hu+2020}; @bks.Venters2022; @rprt.UnitedNations2016].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the superficial mandate of this intervention is education and the\npromotion of continuity of healthcare, its primary strength is the\nindividual that work within it. Under the guidance of the HLO,\nevidence-based care is provided within an environment that promotes\ninterpersonal relationships towards the betterment of one\u0026rsquo;s health and\nwellness. While its no question that the present system is\ndysfunctional, the same system still has the power to make progressive\nchange. It is this resilience that will continue to change the path of\nCanada\u0026rsquo;s carceral system such that justice and human rights can be\nachieved within tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s criminal-[justice]{.underline} system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli id=\"fn:1\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote.
