Furthermore,\nwhile an individual is crossing a jurisdictional limbo, they should feel\na sense of care and compassion from those who have access and authority\nover their file. As a common complaint in the community healthcare\nsetting is the lack of compassion of healthcare personnel, the role of\nthe HLO should be to act as an individual that is consistently present\nand is consistently available for questions and concerns. The third\npoint is essentially the result of continuity of care; by working with\nquality and knowledgeable personnel, the jurisdictions of health are not\njust bridges; they serve as a jumping point for new services previously\nunknown. The work of the HLO not only provides ease in one release from\nfederal custody, but helps it achieve better health outcomes, where the\nsystem and its people work together.

Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSport is a ubiquitous social institution within almost every recorded society (Frey \u0026amp; Eitzen, 1991; Suter, 2009).\nAs such, its universality insinuates a great potential to uphold the dignity of humanity (Frey \u0026amp; Eitzen, 1991; Washington \u0026amp; Karen, 2001). However, sport is itself a social phenomenon deeply woven into the frameworks of society (International Olympic Committee, 2020; Schut, 2018; Washington \u0026amp; Karen, 2001.\nAccording to Feminist theory, society is dominated by the presence of hegemony, in which inequality and exclusion define the discourse of history (English, 2017; Pieper, 2016).\nMoreover, its conception of patriarchy suggests that power is consolidated through sex and gender (English, 2017; Pieper, 2016).\nNotably, sport remains one of the final institutions where sex is conceptualized as a binary (English, 2017; Jarvie, 2012; Pieper, 2016).\nIndividuals that transcend this traditional classification, such as intersex athletes, are deemed incompatible for competition (English, 2017; Jarvie, 2012; Pieper, 2016).\nAlthough Olympism preaches on sports ability to uphold inclusivity, these beliefs suggest otherwise. As such, this paper will examine the biological and social influences specifically to sex.\nBy investigating the case of Foekje Dillema through a Feminist theory perspective, I will argue that our current framework of sex violates the dignity of peoples and impedes any potential to achieving inclusivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-case-study-foekje-dilemma\"\u003e2. Case Study: Foekje Dilemma\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoekje Dillema came into athletic prominence in 1949 with her achievement of the Dutch national record in women’s 200-metre dash (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Kooman, 2003).\nObtained during the Netherland’s annual multi-event Olympic Day, it was especially impressive as it was her first showing in elite sport (Kooman, 2003; Schut, 2018).\nFurther, her record rivaled Fanny Blankers-Koen’s gold medal time from the 1948 London Olympics, in which she made history by winning four gold medals (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Kooman, 2003).\nAlthough Blankers-Koen did not compete, she was in attendance to congratulate Dillema and accept their newfound rivalry (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Kooman, 2003; Schut, 2018).\nIn preparation for the upcoming 1950 European Athletic Championships in\nBrussels, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), as it was previously called, required all female athletes to undergo mandatory sex verification testing (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Kooman, 2003).\nFollowing, Dillema was expelled for life by the Royal Dutch Athletics Federation (KNAU) due to the results of the supposed sex test (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Kooman, 2003).\nDuring a 2011 KNAU board meeting, seven years after her death, it was revealed that Dillema refused to attend, thus meaning the test never took place (Kooman, 2003; Schut, 2018).\nThe fact that her career ended abruptly without appeal or public discourse suggests that assumptions were already made: Dillema was a man.\nMoreover, Dillema’s own internalization of sex and gender did not matter, she was a threat to sport as her appearance violated its ‘natural laws’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-the-social-construction-of-sex\"\u003e3. The Social Construction of Sex\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, it is crucial to differentiate between the concepts of sex and gender.\nAccording to Feminist theory, sex is a product of one’s physical and anatomical traits, while gender is how an individual behaves (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Segrave, 2016).\nAlthough my discussions ultimately consider the concept of sex, their interconnectedness is important to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemporary sport has dominated by the notions of hegemonic masculinity (English, 2017; Jarvie, 2012; Pieper, 2016).\nAlthough this concept aims to identify the conflicts within gender, it upholds that men are physically superior (English, 2017; Jarvie, 2012; Pieper, 2016).\nAlongside Olympism’s fundamental principle of fair play, which seeks to maintain a level playing field, the argument for the sex-segregation of sport appears justifiable (Caplan, 2010; Henne, 2014).\nThus, these guidelines rely heavily on the belief that sex strictly exists as a dimorphism (Caplan, 2010; Schut, 2018).\nHowever, as evident by the case of Dillema, this assumption is inherently flawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA study conducted by Ballantyne et al. (2011) provides important insights to Dillema’s case. In 1950, sex verification testing entailed anatomical investigation (Ballantyne, et al., 2011).\nAs Dillema refused to cooperate in these tests, the justification for her dismissal is likely that ‘she looked like a man’.\nHowever, this raises an important question: if Dillema was certain that she was a woman, why did she not utilize this opportunity to prove it?\nUnfortunately, her personal struggles will never be fully understood as she never publicly spoke of the situation (Ballantyne, et al., 2011; Kooman, 2003).\nNotably, it is important the social climate of the post-WW2 era is likely is the best explanation.\nAlthough important progress was made for women’s sport, the ideals of hegemonic masculinity remained dominant (Kooman, 2003; Schut, 2018).\nThe fact that only women were and have been subject to sex testing supports the notion that sport is highly stratified to favour men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter DNA analysis of Dillema’s worn clothing, Ballantyne et al. (2011) came to the conclusion that she was an intersex individual.\nHowever, regardless of these findings, it is clear that Dillema was targeted by her physical appearance, which gave the perception of an unnatural advantage.\nRegardless, their findings bring important insight to the complexity and ambiguous nature of sex.\nConversely, the definition for being intersex remains a highly contested field of research (Ballantyne et al., 2011; Jenkins \u0026amp; Short, 2017).\nWhile medical studies argue its exact quantitative prevalence, Jenkins \u0026amp; Short (2017) argue that it cannot be pathologized as sex is highly influenced by one’s social condition.\nSimilar to the fluidity of gender, sex is the product of a complex mosaic of genetics that is further influenced by dynamics of social life (Jenkins \u0026amp; Short, 2017).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrucially, sex is not definitive at conception, as sexual differentiation occurs in the sixth week of pregnancy (Wiesemann, 2011).\nWhile it is true that the X and Y Sex chromosomes influence being female or male respectively, the effect in which they influence development exists on a spectrum (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Wiesemann, 2011).\nMoreover, it is possible to lack a sex chromosome, have an extra sex chromosome, or for a given sex chromosome to ‘change its function’ within prenatal development (Wiesemann, 2011).\nAs the sex chromosome influences the development of external genitalia, ambiguity can be produced (Wiesemann, 2011).\nFurthermore, sex is highly influenced over the course of one’s lifetime (Wiesemann, 2011).\nAlthough mainly during puberty, the sexual hormones elicit ‘male’ or ‘female’ secondary sexual traits (Wiesemann, 2011).\nGiven the variability of gonadal development in-utero, these characteristics also exist on a spectrum (Wiesemann, 2011).\nIn addition, environmental and social factors such as stress, physical environment, and the internalization of gender influence the spectrum of sexual development (Wiesemann, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-sex-testing-and-inclusivity\"\u003e4. Sex Testing and Inclusivity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 1950 and 1992 the IAAF required all female athletes to undergo mandatory sex verification testing (Ballantyne et al., 2011).\nAs a means to maintain the integrity of competition, it is clear that inclusivity was not their priority.\nDespite the increase of women in contemporary sport, its founding principles of hegemonic masculinity remain rooted in its framework (English; Jarvie, 2012; Pieper, 2016).\nThe recent example of Caster Semenya, in which she also faced controversy for the perceived violation of natural laws, serves as evidence to its problematic nature and longevity (Shultz, 2011).\nThe World Medical Association, which operates alongside the United Nations Human Rights Council, have criticized the IAAF’s use of sex testing as unscientific, unethical, and in direct violation of human rights (Wiesemann, 2011).\nAlthough sex testing ceased in 1992, the ability to assess the sex of participants under any suspicion remains possible (Ballantyne et al., 2011; Wiesemann, 2011).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-conclusion\"\u003e5. Conclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my investigation for potential subject matters, I found the controversies of sex testing most interesting as it so clearly violates Olympism’s ideals of inclusivity.\nThe case of Foekje Dillema provides an important example of the dehumanizing policies and practices of sex-testing in sport.\nHer athleticism and achievement of a national record in her first year of elite competition proves her sporting potential.\nIf sport was socially constructed differently, there is no question Dillema would have worked her way to the Olympic games.\nHowever, with so many potential obstacles in front of her, her career was forced to end. In past classes, I often found the concept of hegemonic masculinity difficult to grasp I personally identify as a man.\nHowever, in this case, it is extremely obvious.\nThe fact that Dillema was expelled simply by refusing to cooperate in the sex-test demonstrates the dominant position men hold in sport.\nIn addition, given the recent case of Caster Semenya, it is clear that nothing has changed since Dillema’s expulsion.\nMoreover, sport remains fundamentally exclusive to individuals that don’t fit normality of male or female.\nThus, I present my ultimate question: can sport continue to operate under the influence of sex dimorphism?\nGiven my presented evidence, I argue that sport in its present form is a sickness within society discriminated against people through primitive means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe opinions expressed in this manuscript are those of the author.\nThey do not purport to reflect the opinions or views of the University of British Columbia or its members.\nPlease reach out to me if you have any comments, questions, or concerns.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis manuscript was submitted for the term paper of KIN 364 (The Modern Olympics) at the University of British Columbia.\nThis manuscript was graded an \u003cstrong\u003eA+\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"references\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBallantyne, K.
