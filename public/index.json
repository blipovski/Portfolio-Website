While the transition of\nhealthcare from the CSC to the respective province or territory is a\nsignificant barrier to continuity, this paper argues that it is an\nopportunity, as discussed in the previous section on education. In\naddition to easing stains during file transfers, the ability to\nrecommend \u0026quot;new\u0026quot; services, such as safe needle exchanges that receive\nlittle to no attention within the CSC, is a clear advantage\n[@{.Kronfli+2021}; @bks.Gardner2022; @{.Kouyoumdjian+2018}; @{.Hu+2020}].\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this paper will not discuss the specifics of its\nadministration, these principles of continuity of care are discussed\nbelow. First, the CSC should provide a complete and comprehensive file\nof the services and history provided during the course during which the\nindividual was incarcerated. Such information should be delivered to the\nHLO in a timely manner to ensure the ease of one\u0026rsquo;s transition over the\nrapid events post-release. Second, the presented file should ideally be\ncovered by as few individuals as possible to ensure consistency in\npersonnel and information available for a given individual. Together,\nboth steps should enable the HLO to act as a intermediary not only for\ninformation but also for emotional stressors released on an individual.\nSimilarly, the continuity of care by the HLO from the CSC to the\nprovincial or territorial health authority should promote humanity and\ninterpersonal relationships to foster trust and belonging. Furthermore,\nwhile an individual is crossing a jurisdictional limbo, they should feel\na sense of care and compassion from those who have access and authority\nover their file. As a common complaint in the community healthcare\nsetting is the lack of compassion of healthcare personnel, the role of\nthe HLO should be to act as an individual that is consistently present\nand is consistently available for questions and concerns. The third\npoint is essentially the result of continuity of care; by working with\nquality and knowledgeable personnel, the jurisdictions of health are not\njust bridges; they serve as a jumping point for new services previously\nunknown. The work of the HLO not only provides ease in one release from\nfederal custody, but helps it achieve better health outcomes, where the\nsystem and its people work together. Thus, the second mandate of this\nintervention framework seeks to further the aforementioned concept of\nthe \u0026quot;duopoly of responsibility\u0026quot;.

Introduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSport is a ubiquitous social institution within almost every recorded\nsociety (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Frey1991\"\u003eFrey \u0026amp; Eitzen, 1991\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-docSuter2009\"\u003eSuter,\n2009\u003c/a\u003e). As such, its universality insinuates a great\npotential to uphold the dignity of humanity (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Frey1991\"\u003eFrey \u0026amp; Eitzen,\n1991\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Washington2001\"\u003eWashington \u0026amp; Karen, 2001\u003c/a\u003e).\nHowever, sport is itself a social phenomenon deeply woven into the\nframeworks of society\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-docInternationalOlympicCommittee2020\"\u003eInternational Olympic Committee, 2020\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-miscSchut2018\"\u003eSchut, 2018\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Washington2001\"\u003eWashington \u0026amp; Karen, 2001\u003c/a\u003e).\nAccording to Feminist theory, society is\ndominated by the presence of hegemony, in which inequality and exclusion\ndefine the discourse of history (\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish, 2017\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003ePieper, 2017\u003c/a\u003e). Moreover, its conception of\npatriarchy suggests that power is consolidated through sex and gender\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish, 2017\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003ePieper, 2017\u003c/a\u003e).\nNotably, sport remains one of the final institutions where sex is\nconceptualized as a binary (\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish, 2017\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Jarvie2011\"\u003eJarvie,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003ePieper, 2017\u003c/a\u003e). Individuals\nthat transcend this traditional classification, such as intersex\nathletes, are deemed incompatible for competition (\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish,\n2017\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Jarvie2011\"\u003eJarvie, 2011\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003ePieper,\n2017\u003c/a\u003e). Although Olympism preaches on sports ability\nto uphold inclusivity, these beliefs suggest otherwise. As such, this\npaper will examine the biological and social influences specifically to\nsex. By investigating the case of Foekje Dillema through a Feminist\ntheory perspective, I will argue that our current framework of sex\nviolates the dignity of peoples and impedes any potential to achieving\ninclusivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-case-study-foekje-dilemma\"\u003e2. Case Study: Foekje Dilemma\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFoekje Dillema came into athletic prominence in 1949 with her\nachievement of the Dutch national record in women’s 200-metre dash\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman,\n2003\u003c/a\u003e). Obtained during the Netherland’s annual\nmulti-event Olympic Day, it was especially impressive as it was her\nfirst showing in elite sport (\u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman, 2003\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-miscSchut2018\"\u003eSchut,\n2018\u003c/a\u003e). Further, her record rivaled Fanny\nBlankers-Koen’s gold medal time from the 1948 London Olympics, in which\nshe made history by winning four gold medals (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al.,\n2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman, 2003\u003c/a\u003e).\nAlthough Blankers-Koen did not compete, she was in attendance to\ncongratulate Dillema and accept their newfound rivalry (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et\nal., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman, 2003\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-miscSchut2018\"\u003eSchut, 2018\u003c/a\u003e). In preparation for the upcoming 1950\nEuropean Athletic Championships in Brussels, the International Amateur\nAthletics Federation (IAAF), as it was previously called, required all\nfemale athletes to undergo mandatory sex verification testing\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman,\n2003\u003c/a\u003e). Following, Dillema was expelled for life by\nthe Royal Dutch Athletics Federation (KNAU) due to the results of the\nsupposed sex test (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al., 2012\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman, 2003\u003c/a\u003e). During a 2011 KNAU board meeting,\nseven years after her death, it was revealed that Dillema refused to\nattend, thus meaning the test never took place (\u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman,\n2003\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-miscSchut2018\"\u003eSchut, 2018\u003c/a\u003e). The fact\nthat her career ended abruptly without appeal or public discourse\nsuggests that assumptions were already made: Dillema was a man.\nMoreover, Dillema’s own internalization of sex and gender did not\nmatter, she was a threat to sport as her appearance violated its\n‘natural laws’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-the-social-construction-of-sex\"\u003e3. The Social Construction of Sex\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, it is crucial to differentiate between the concepts of sex and\ngender. According to Feminist theory, sex is a product of one’s physical\nand anatomical traits, while gender is how an individual behaves\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Segrave2016\"\u003eSegrave,\n2016\u003c/a\u003e). Although my discussions ultimately consider\nthe concept of sex, their interconnectedness is important to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemporary sport has dominated by the notions of hegemonic masculinity\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish, 2017\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Jarvie2011\"\u003eJarvie, 2011\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003ePieper, 2017\u003c/a\u003e). Although this concept aims to\nidentify the conflicts within gender, it upholds that men are physically\nsuperior (\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish, 2017\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Jarvie2011\"\u003eJarvie,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003ePieper, 2017\u003c/a\u003e). Alongside\nOlympism’s fundamental principle of fair play, which seeks to maintain a\nlevel playing field, the argument for the sex-segregation of sport\nappears justifiable (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Caplan2010\"\u003eCaplan, 2010\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Henne2014\"\u003eHenne,\n2014\u003c/a\u003e). Thus, these guidelines rely heavily on the\nbelief that sex strictly exists as a dimorphism (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Caplan2010\"\u003eCaplan,\n2010\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-miscSchut2018\"\u003eSchut, 2018\u003c/a\u003e). However, as\nevident by the case of Dillema, this assumption is inherently flawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA study conducted by Ballantyne et al. (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003e2012\u003c/a\u003e)\nprovides important insights to Dillema’s case. In 1950, sex verification\ntesting entailed anatomical investigation (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al.,\n2012\u003c/a\u003e). As Dillema refused to cooperate in these\ntests, the justification for her dismissal is likely that ‘she looked\nlike a man’. However, this raises an important question: if Dillema was\ncertain that she was a woman, why did she not utilize this opportunity\nto prove it? Unfortunately, her personal struggles will never be fully\nunderstood as she never publicly spoke of the situation (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et\nal., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman, 2003\u003c/a\u003e).\nNotably, it is important the social climate of the post-WW2 era is\nlikely is the best explanation. Although important progress was made for\nwomen’s sport, the ideals of hegemonic masculinity remained dominant\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-bkKooman2003\"\u003eKooman, 2003\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-miscSchut2018\"\u003eSchut, 2018\u003c/a\u003e).\nThe fact that only women were and have been subject to sex testing\nsupports the notion that sport is highly stratified to favour men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter DNA analysis of Dillema’s worn clothing, Ballantyne et al.\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003e2012\u003c/a\u003e) came to the conclusion that she was an\nintersex individual. However, regardless of these findings, it is clear\nthat Dillema was targeted by her physical appearance, which gave the\nperception of an unnatural advantage. Regardless, their findings bring\nimportant insight to the complexity and ambiguous nature of sex.\nConversely, the definition for being intersex remains a highly contested\nfield of research (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al., 2012\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-Jenkins2017\"\u003eJenkins \u0026amp; Short, 2017\u003c/a\u003e). While medical studies argue\nits exact quantitative prevalence, Jenkins \u0026amp; Short\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Jenkins2017\"\u003e2017\u003c/a\u003e) argue that it cannot be pathologized as sex\nis highly influenced by one’s social condition. Similar to the fluidity\nof gender, sex is the product of a complex mosaic of genetics that is\nfurther influenced by dynamics of social life (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Jenkins2017\"\u003eJenkins \u0026amp; Short,\n2017\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrucially, sex is not definitive at conception, as sexual\ndifferentiation occurs in the sixth week of pregnancy (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e). While it is true that the X and Y Sex\nchromosomes influence being female or male respectively, the effect in\nwhich they influence development exists on a spectrum (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et\nal., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e). Moreover, it is possible to lack a sex\nchromosome, have an extra sex chromosome, or for a given sex chromosome\nto ‘change its function’ within prenatal development (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e). As the sex chromosome influences the\ndevelopment of external genitalia, ambiguity can be produced\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann, 2011\u003c/a\u003e). Furthermore, sex is highly\ninfluenced over the course of one’s lifetime (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e). Although mainly during puberty, the sexual\nhormones elicit ‘male’ or ‘female’ secondary sexual traits (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e). Given the variability of gonadal development\nin-utero, these characteristics also exist on a spectrum (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e). In addition, environmental and social\nfactors such as stress, physical environment, and the internalization of\ngender influence the spectrum of sexual development (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-sex-testing-and-inclusivity\"\u003e4. Sex Testing and Inclusivity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween 1950 and 1992 the IAAF required all female athletes to undergo\nmandatory sex verification testing (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al.,\n2012\u003c/a\u003e). As a means to maintain the integrity of\ncompetition, it is clear that inclusivity was not their priority.\nDespite the increase of women in contemporary sport, its founding\nprinciples of hegemonic masculinity remain rooted in its framework\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-English2017\"\u003eEnglish, 2017\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Jarvie2011\"\u003eJarvie, 2011\u003c/a\u003e;\n\u003ca href=\"#ref-bksPieper2017\"\u003eJarvie, 2017\u003c/a\u003e). The recent example of Caster Semenya, in\nwhich she also faced controversy for the perceived violation of natural\nlaws, serves as evidence to its problematic nature and longevity\n(\u003ca href=\"#ref-Schultz2011\"\u003eSchultz, 2011\u003c/a\u003e). The World Medical Association,\nwhich operates alongside the United Nations Human Rights Council, have\ncriticized the IAAF’s use of sex testing as unscientific, unethical, and\nin direct violation of human rights (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,2011\u003c/a\u003e).\nAlthough sex testing ceased in 1992, the\nability to assess the sex of participants under any suspicion remains\npossible (\u003ca href=\"#ref-Ballantyne+2012\"\u003eBallantyne et al., 2012\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"#ref-Wiesemann2011\"\u003eWiesemann,\n2011\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-conclusion\"\u003e5. Conclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my investigation for potential subject matters, I found the\ncontroversies of sex testing most interesting as it so clearly violates\nOlympism’s ideals of inclusivity. The case of Foekje Dillema provides an\nimportant example of the dehumanizing policies and practices of\nsex-testing in sport. Her athleticism and achievement of a national\nrecord in her first year of elite competition proves her sporting\npotential. If sport was socially constructed differently, there is no\nquestion Dillema would have worked her way to the Olympic games.\nHowever, with so many potential obstacles in front of her, her career\nwas forced to end. In past classes, I often found the concept of\nhegemonic masculinity difficult to grasp I personally identify as a man.\nHowever, in this case, it is extremely obvious. The fact that Dillema\nwas expelled simply by refusing to cooperate in the sex-test\ndemonstrates the dominant position men hold in sport. In addition, given\nthe recent case of Caster Semenya, it is clear that nothing has changed\nsince Dillema’s expulsion. Moreover, sport remains fundamentally\nexclusive to individuals that don’t fit normality of male or female.\nThus, I present my ultimate question: can sport continue to operate\nunder the influence of sex dimorphism? Given my presented evidence, I\nargue that sport in its present form is a sickness within society\ndiscriminated against people through primitive means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe opinions expressed in this manuscript are those of the author.
