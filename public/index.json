Furthermore,\nwhile an individual is crossing a jurisdictional limbo, they should feel\na sense of care and compassion from those who have access and authority\nover their file. As a common complaint in the community healthcare\nsetting is the lack of compassion of healthcare personnel, the role of\nthe HLO should be to act as an individual that is consistently present\nand is consistently available for questions and concerns. The third\npoint is essentially the result of continuity of care; by working with\nquality and knowledgeable personnel, the jurisdictions of health are not\njust bridges; they serve as a jumping point for new services previously\nunknown. The work of the HLO not only provides ease in one release from\nfederal custody, but helps it achieve better health outcomes, where the\nsystem and its people work together. Thus, the second mandate of this\nintervention framework seeks to further the aforementioned concept of\nthe \u0026quot;duopoly of responsibility\u0026quot;.
